# Retrofit API Calls App

This project demonstrates how to make successful API calls using the Retrofit HTTP client in an Android application. The app fetches and displays available products through a LazyColumn, focusing on efficiently handling HTTP requests and responses.

## Features

- **API Calls with Retrofit**: Efficiently handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Kotlin and MVVM**: Utilizes Kotlin and the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for robust and maintainable code.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Displays products through a LazyColumn for a modern UI approach.
- **Coil Library**: Efficiently loads and displays images in the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- **Kotlin**: A modern programming language that makes developers happier.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A design pattern for separating concerns in code.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI.
- **Coil**: An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
